      The <b>Renaissance</b> was a shift from Medieval art to realism which was
      used during the <br />
      renaissance. The Renaissance started, in Italy, as the “proto Renaissance”
      in the years 1280-<br />
      1400, during this time the artists started to reawaken the ideals and
      achievements of classical<br />
      Roman culture; however, this was stifled due to war and plague, and its
      influences didn’t<br />
      appear again until the early 1400s. In the beginning there were different
      major artists than the<br />
      ones we know of, such as the sculptor <i>Lorenzo Ghiberti</i>, and painter
      <i>Masaccio</i>.

    <p>
      By the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> century Rome became the center of the
      Renaissance instead of<br />
      Florence, Italy, this period was known as the <b>High Renaissance</b>, and
      this is when the 3<br />
      great artists-<i>Leonardo da Vinci</i>, <i>Michelangelo</i>,
      <i>and Rapheal</i>- became known.
      <br />
      <i>Leonardo</i> was a famous painter that expressed the humanist and
      classical values of<br />
      the era, his most known painting would be the “Mona Lisa”.
      <i>Michelangelo</i> was most<br />
      known for his sculptors, one of his more known pieces is David in
      Florence, he also<br /> created a sculptor called Pieta, while not
      his area of expertise he also created<br /> paintings, such as the one covering
      the ceiling in 
      the Sistine chapel. The last is <i>Rapheal</i>,<br /> he was a painter and a
      sculptor, one of his
      more known paintings is the<br /> “School of Athens” that was painted in the
      Vatican.

    <!--This paragraph talks about the 3 artists Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Rapheal,as well as their famous work-->
    <p>
      During the late 1500s the Mannerist style started to appear which is a
      style that<br />
      emphasized artificiality instead of the realism of the renaissance, this
      style, overtime <br />
      replaced realism and thus the renaissance came to an end.

      The realism of the Renaissance affected the design of this website by
      making it<br />
      grounded to reality, such as using blue or green colors because people see
      these <br />
      colors every time they step outside.

    <!--this is how realism impacted the website-->
